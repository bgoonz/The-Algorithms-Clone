## Contributing New Algorithms

- Make your pull requests to be **specific** and **focused**. Instead of contributing "several algorithms" all at once contribute them all one by one separately (i.e. one pull request for "Logistic Regression", another one for "K-Means" and so on).

- Every new algorithm must have:
  - **Source code** with comments and readable namings
  - **Math** being explained in README.md along with the code
  - **Jupyter demo notebook** with example of how this new algorithm may be applied

If you're adding new **datasets** they need to be saved in the `/data` folder. CSV files are preferable. The size of the file should not be greater than `30Mb`.

## Contributing

Before removing any bug, or adding new algorithm please do the following: **[Check Contribution Guidelines Before Contribution](Contributing.md)** and also please read **[CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.
